Birthing people remember their births for their entire lives. Research shows that compassionate doula care decreases birth interventions, improves newborn outcomes, improves satisfaction with the birth experience, increases breastfeeding rates, and reduces postpartum anxiety and depression. These are incredibly important effects that can ripple through the family and wider community for years, and generations, to come.

<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px">I believe strongly that everyone who desires doula support deserves it. And, that doula support is an incredibly worthwhile investment in our community.</p>

Women have been supporting each other during their births for millennia. In modern times the energy exchange comes in the form of financial compensation that I recognize is not always affordable to everyone.

In an effort to improve accessibility to doula support, while also keeping my doula practice sustainable, I am available for one sliding-scale birth client per month and/or up to 20 hours of sliding-scale daytime postpartum care.

My scale is primarily based on the concept of hardship versus sacrifice. If you would have to budget for doula support, perhaps by cutting back on extras such as entertainment, eating out, or non-essential purchases, it qualifies as a sacrifice. If paying for doula support would impact your ability to meet your basic needs, it would be a hardship.

My sliding-scale fees are based on trust – I do not ask for income verification. Please be mindful that if you request a sliding-scale fee when you can comfortably afford my full fee, you are limiting access to doula support for those who would truly benefit.

I have taken inspiration for this offering from Alexis J. Cunningfolk, who originated the <a href="http://www.wortsandcunning.com/blog/sliding-scale">Green Bottle model</a> of sliding scale fees.
