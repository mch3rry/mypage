  <p>As a nurse with nearly 20 years ER experience I wanted an evidence based approach to labour & delivery, and as much support as possible preparing for labour and delivery in my final month. The knowledge Danielle gave us better prepared us to advocate for less medicalizarion at several points throughout the induction and delivery process. We declined to have ROM when the OB team request several days prior to delivery, we declined the immediate use of epidural as encouraged at triage and we likely would have had a cesarean outcome due to these interventions and the team offering at the end of delivery!! Danielle provided the knowledge and research, then allowed us to make our own decisions, only when asked did she give us her recommendations. Her knowledge, skills and tools provided pain relief, calmness and  a holistic approach to labour. My husband was more supportive than I would’ve ever imagined and he credits knowing what to do completely to Danielle. We have reflected on what went well and not so well many times and everytime we reiterate how greatful are to have hired the services of nurtured birth as they are the reason we had the lovely aspects of labour and ultimately the vaginal birth I wanted.</p>

  <p>As first-time parents with no idea what to expect during pregnancy, labour, and delivery, we were incredibly fortunate to have Danielle by our side. She walked us through every step of the process, and she was always available to answer our questions and alleviate our concerns. Thanks to her thorough preparation, nothing took us by surprise when it came time for labour and delivery. In the delivery room, Danielle's presence was supportive yet unobtrusive, allowing my husband and I to share the experience together. Even when things didn’t go according to my birth plan, Danielle’s guidance helped me remain calm and unafraid. I look back at the birth very fondly, and we would love to have Danielle as our doula again for our next child.</p>

  <p>Working with Danielle was a great experience! The two sessions prior to the birth were a gold mine of information for us first time parents. Having her on our team at the hospital was very reassuring and helpful. I'd recommend her services to anyone having a baby!</p>

  <p>We had a great experience with Danielle! She supported us from after our son's birth until he was about 8 weeks old. One of the highlights for us was Danielle's flexibility. Originally we had assumed she would be doing lots of baby holding as our first child was an extremely fussy infant, never wanting to be put down. As it turns our, our son was a very calm, very sleepy baby. So Danielle was incredibly flexible and supportive providing not only care for our infant son, but also taking care of our toddler when needed (playing with her, feeding her, etc.), doing light housework, cooking our meals, cleaning baby bottles and providing emotional support especially around feeding. We would absolutely recommend her for support postpartum!</p>

  <p>Danielle was extremely supportive and helpful before, during and after the birth of my daughter. She was there for us emotionally, mentally, and physically (when she had to hold my leg!). I gave birth in a hospital in the middle of the Covid19 pandemic, a very stressful time, but Danielle helped to reassure us that we were in a safe space and calm any nerves. The birth happened very fast so we were not able to give her much notice, but she showed up at the hospital right away and was ready to support in every way. Danielle also checked in with us after the birth, coming to our home to offer support and guidance.</p>

  <p>Danielle was  a huge help and instrumental to guiding a positive birth story. Donny and I felt very supported throughout and leading up to the birth of our baby girl born November 24, 2020. I truly do not believe I would have felt as mentally, physically or emotionally prepared for my labour and delivery without having her by my side. She was able to know my preferences and understand my concerns as well as Donny's and talk and guide us through them prior to birth, during labour and after with postpartum visits to our home. Having her arrive prior to the midwife to the labour was probably the most help I felt I needed mentally and emotionally in that moment. She has a calm and  reassuring presence as the intensity built I never felt her waiver. I was close to an induction due to my waters breaking before any contractions or active labour signs and once again I really believe if I was in a negative or anxious head space after my waters broke that I would not have entered labour as successfully naturally within the time window necessary prior to induction as so much of it relates to our psychological and emotional experience driving the hormones and processes that guide our bodies through birth. Danielle was foundational to my confidence and relaxation as the labour started and continued. I was able to follow my birth preferences and did not feel worried if things were to stray or have to change paths. I knew that no matter what she would advocate for our family and work along with the midwives to ensure that the experience was amazing and baby girl would enter  our lives in the best way possible in that moment. Discussing concerns and feelings with Danielle in prenatal sessions (for myself and Donny, my partner) was pivotal as it helped us communicate between eachother our personal worries or thoughts that we may not have otherwise realized or voiced out loud. I recommend her whole-heartedly!</p>
