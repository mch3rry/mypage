<p>Doulas know that not all pregnancies end with the birth of a child. If you are experiencing a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), or have elected to terminate a pregnancy, you deserve support as your pregnancy releases.</p>

<p>Abortion support may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help navigating the healthcare system</li>
  <li>Guidance on your options, and what to expect</li>
  <li>Attending appointments with you, or dropping you off and picking you up</li>
  <li>Comfort measures as your pregnancy releases</li>
  <li>Non-judgemental emotional support</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fee:</b> Abortion support is available to everyone at no cost.</p>
